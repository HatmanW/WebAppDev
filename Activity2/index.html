            <p>

            I'm John Winchester. I'm currently an M.I.S. Student at UNO. 
			I have 10+ years of small business experience in computer hardware
			2 associate degrees, one in mechanical drafting, the other in electronics networking design and support. 
			I'm currently a fast tracked Senior, which means I'm taking some graduate level courses that cross list into a masters as well as a bachelors.
			I'm also a tutor for the CLSC, a year round hardware intern for Union Pacific, and a technology director for a Non profit.

			This has been a crash course in getting HTML, CSS, and potentially some Bootstrap back online.
