READ ME for activity 3 for ISQA 3900

This is the Activity 3 read me file. 
In this assignment we create a grading calculator based on a 1000 pt course. 
the user enters a 0-1000 pt score, and a print statement issues a letter grade accordingly. 
There's a lot in terms of backend work, however the front end is very simple. 
The main user experience is A score, 
a print out of the score, and a prompt to enter a new score or exit the program.
